# AirBnB_clone v1 - File storage / Console

We made this project in order to learn how to recreate the AirBnB website, from the back-end data management to the front-end user interface.

This repo contains the first part of the project which consists in :

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
